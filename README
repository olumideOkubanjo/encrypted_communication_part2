Major Assignment 2: Part 1

Included Files:
    encrypt_communication_part1.cpp
    README
    Makefile

Accessories:
    2 Arduino Mega Boards (AMGs)
    1 Resistor
    1 Breadborad
    2 Usb to arduino wires 
    6 Pin wires

Wiring  instructions:
    Connect Arduino A to PC A using an USB to arduino cable.
    Connect Arduino B to PC B using an USB to arduino cable.
    Arduino A  Pin 13  <--> Resistor <---> Arduino B 5V+
    Arduino B  Pin 13  <--> Arduino A GND
    Arduino A  TX3 <---> Arduino B RX3
    Arduino B  TX3 <---> Arduino A RX3
    Arduino B  GND <---> Arduino A GND
    

Running  Instructions:
    Ensure that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/dev/ttyACM0) On both computers.
    While in the directory containing the files encrypt_communication_part1.cpp and the Makefile.
    Use the command "make upload && serial-mon" to  upload  the  code to the Arduino and open the serial monitor for PC A and PC B

Notes and Assumptions:
    We asssume that the setup has been done correctly as specified in the description of the assignment.
    We also assume that the user will not be overloading the buffer with bytes.

Functionality:

    In the program, a person Types a char into their respective serial monitor then the program encrypts the character that is typed and sends it 
    to the serial on the other PC which then decrypts it and displays it to that serial monitor.

    If the enter key is pressed both the \r and \n characters are encrypted and sent to serial three and the receiving serial monitor reads and decrpyts twice
    and displays both the \r and \n characters.

    Both PCs in this assignment can send and receive characters.

    The encryption and decryption are used to encrypt the messages from the the sender's PC to Serial 3 where the receiver's Arduino would read
    from Serial3 and decrypt the message using the same function but with different passed parameters into the function.
